## [Project 1: Toy Swap Mobile App](https://github.com/ChillitheCode/Toy-Swap-Mobile-App.git)
This is a cross platform mobile phone app developed using Xamarin forms. The app targets parents of young children who would rather swap unused children toys with another family, rather than buying a new toy at retail price from a toy distributor. The app is designed in an MVVM framework, and data persistence was supported through the implementation of a cloud service provider (Firebase Realtime Database).

## Project 2: First FAQ Website
A knowledge-base system where users can post and answer questions.
The core functionality consists of three screens: home page, login, add question.

## Project 2: FLC for Indoor Climates
I designed and implemented of a fuzzy logic system optimised by evolutionary computation for controlling the climate of rooms in university building. The Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) will receive crisp values as input and class them by the designed fuzzy representation, the fuzzy values represent the climate for each of the five monitored environmental variables. The system uses Mamdani rule inference to calculate a solution, producing a fuzzy output value for each actuator accordingly. The inference engine will determine the required solutions to maintain a suitable climate. A total of 25 different IFTHEN rules are used to describe the systems behaviour. The defuzzifier then translates these fuzzy output values into crisp values to be used by the respective control system. The FLC defuzzifies the output into a crisp value using the COG (Centre of Gravity) method. The Fuzzy logic system uses a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) structure.

## Project 3: Implementing Object Detection into Orna RPG
I attempted to develop a object detection feature that could be implemented into Orna RPG. Several object detection methods were tested on objects found on the Orna World Map. Two of the approaches implemented that achieved semi-functionality were, the SIFT approach and the template matching. The template matching approach accurately detected all 11 templates. The SIFT approach had similar results with 10 out of the 11 objects accurately detected. The multi-scale template matching and colour detection approaches didn't reach a functional state due to tight time constraints. The implementations with the highest performances could then be developed to function within the Orna RPG source code. In the long term, object detection could be implemented into the Orna RPG to improve the user experience. The approach could be implemented to specify to the players which enemies, NPCs, buildings are visible on the world map. This solution is ideally focused towards created an altered intuitive experience for "high-need" gamers.
