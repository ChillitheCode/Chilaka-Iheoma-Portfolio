# Project 1: Toy Swap Mobile App
This is a cross platform mobile phone app developed using Xamarin forms. The app targets parents of young children who would rather swap unused children toys with another family, rather than buying a new toy at retail price from a toy distributor. The app is designed in an MVVM framework, and data persistence was supported through the implementation of a cloud service provider (Firebase Realtime Database).
