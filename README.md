## [Project 1: Toy Swap Mobile App](https://github.com/ChillitheCode/Toy-Swap-Mobile-App.git)
This is a cross platform mobile phone app developed using Xamarin forms. The app targets parents of young children who would rather swap unused children toys with another family, rather than buying a new toy at retail price from a toy distributor. The app is designed in an MVVM framework, and data persistence was supported through the implementation of a cloud service provider (Firebase Realtime Database).
This project was completed with Coventry University.
Time constraint = 4 weeks

## Project 2: First FAQ Website
A knowledge-base system where users can post and answer questions.
The core functionality consists of three screens: home page, login, add question.

## Project 2: FLC for Indoor Climates
In a solo project whilst studying at Coventry University, I designed and implemented of a fuzzy logic system optimised by evolutionary computation for controlling the climate of rooms in university building. The Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) will receive crisp values as input and class them by the designed fuzzy representation, the fuzzy values represent the climate for each of the five monitored environmental variables. The system uses Mamdani rule inference to calculate a solution, producing a fuzzy output value for each actuator accordingly. The inference engine will determine the required solutions to maintain a suitable climate. A total of 25 different IFTHEN rules are used to describe the systems behaviour. The defuzzifier then translates these fuzzy output values into crisp values to be used by the respective control system. The FLC defuzzifies the output into a crisp value using the COG (Centre of Gravity) method. The Fuzzy logic system uses a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) structure.
